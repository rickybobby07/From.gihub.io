This project entails developing a registration form for a language-learning website that caters to people who are interested in learning new languages online. Users can input their personal information and language preferences in a clear and organized manner thanks to the registration form's accessible and user-friendly design. To improve the user experience, the form uses JavaScript validation and auto-fill functions. Name, address, email, password, phone number, and first language fields must be filled out on the registration form. A dropdown menu for the user's first language is also provided on the form, along with a choice to translate the website into that language if it is not English. Depending on whether they have chosen to have the platform translated or not, clicking submit advances the user to the following page. To ensure that the registration form is semantic, accessible, and offers helpful features like validation and auto-fill, technical requirements for it include the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We can enhance the user experience and make it simpler for people to register for the language learning platform by developing a registration form that is accessible, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing.
